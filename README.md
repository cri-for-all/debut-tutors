# Exercises

## Practice with Python :
For the below exercises, open up a new script in Sublime Text (make sure you set the language to "python" by saving the file with a ".py" extention). Then open a SublimeREPL for python by pressing [cmd] + [shift] + P and typing "SublimeREPL: Python". Then check that SendCode will send python statments to your SublimeREPL by pressing [cmd] + [shift] + P and typing "SendCode: Choose Program". When the list of optional programs appears, select "SublimeREPL". You can now send pieces of your code from your script directly to the REPL by highlighting the code and pressing [cmd] + [enter]. 

1) Create a variable named x equal to a string (write what you want) and then print it

2) Create a variable named b that is equal to x (the variable created above), and then print "I'm saying: " + variable b

3) Write a python program that ask the user for their name and height, and then print a sentence containing both details

4) Write a Hello-World program that prints "Hello world" and then asks the user to respond by asking "How would you like to respond?". Once the user responds, have the program print the user's answer.

5) Create a few int variables and some float variables. Then practice with different simple operations ( +, /, %, -, *,...).

6) I have these 9 variables. What is the type of each one? Write it in a comment next to the variables.

    a = 5

    b = "GitHub"
    
    c = 7.5
    
    d = "j"
    
    e = -10
    
    f = -10.0
    
    g = ('GitHub', 10, 'j', 25.4)
    
    h = ['GitHub', 10, 'j', 25.4]
    
    i = {'GitHub' : 10, 'j' : 25.4, 'john' : 'help', 100.0 : 34}

7) Create an if-statement that tests if a variable, x, is even. It should print the string "That's true, x is even!" if x is even, and "Sorry, it looks like x is odd. Try again!" otherwise. Notice that you will have to declare the variable x first for the script to work.

## Practice with the Terminal : 
For the next exercises, we are going to practice a bit with terminal commands. If you are on MacOS or linux, open a standard terminal. If you are on Windows, you will need to use a terminal emmulater like cmder.

8) What is the command that will return the git version you are using?

9) What is the command line for changing the current folder/directory?

10) What is the command line for listing the contents of the current folder/directory?

11) What is the command line for creating a file?

12) What is the command line for creating a new folder/directory?

13) What is the command line for deleting a folder/directory?

14) What is the command line for deleting a file?

15) With the appropriate command line, find the version of the computer's git.

16) With the appropriate command line, change the name of the computer's git to "Admin" or whatever you want.

17) Type "git --help" in the Terminal. What does it do?

## Finish early?

18) If you finished early, try to write a script that will have a short conversation with the user. The script should be able to understand the following inputs:

    "Hello"

    "How are you?"

    "What time is it?"

    When the user gives an input, the script should read the string and then give an appropriate response. If you write         "Hello", the script would respond "Hello!". If you ask "What time is it?" the script should print the current time. If       you write "How are you?", try to have the script respond either "I am good." or "I am great", where the answer is           random. 

    Good luck!
    
## Don't forget, perseverance is really important when it doesn't work, but never hesitate to ask for a hint!!!
