# Exercises

## Practice with Python :

1) In a file, create a variable a equal to a string (write what you want) and then print it

2) Create a variable named b that is equal to a, and then print "I'm saying: " + variable b

3) Write a python program that ask the user for their name and height, and then print a sentence containing both details

4) Write a Hello-World program and then add a part that asks the user to respond and the prints the user's answer

5) Create three int variables, and some float variables, and practise with different simple operations ( +, /, %, -, *,...)

6) I have these 9 variables. What is the type of each one? Write it in a comment next to the variables!

    a = 5

    b = "GitHub"
    
    c = 7.5
    
    d = "j"
    
    e = -10
    
    f = -10.0
    
    g = ('GitHub', 10, 'j', 25.4)
    
    h = ['GitHub', 10, 'j', 25.4]
    
    i = {'GitHub' : 10, 'j' : 25.4, 'john' : 'help', 100.0 : 34}

7) Create an if-statement that tests if a variable, x, is even and prints the string "That's true!" if x is even, and "try again!" otherwise 

## Practice with the Terminal : 

8) Write the command to get the Python version you are using

9) What is the command line for changing the current folder/directory?

10) What is the command line for listing the contents of the current folder/directory?

11) What is the command line for creating a file?

12) What is the command line for creating a new folder/directory?

13) What is the command line for deleting a folder/directory?

14) What is the command line for deleting a file?

15) With the appropriate command line, find the version of the computer's git.

16) With the appropriate command line, change the name of the computer's git to "Admin" or whatever you want.

17) Type "git --help" in the Terminal. What does it do?

## Finish early?

18) If you finished early, try to write a script that will have a short conversation with the user. The script should be able to understand the following inputs:

    "Hello"

    "How are you?"

    "What time is it?"

    When the user gives an input, the script should read the string and then give an appropriate response. If you write         "Hello", the script would respond "Hello!". If you ask "What time is it?" the script should print the current time. If       you write "How are you?", try to have the script respond either "I am good." or "I am great", where the answer is           random. 

    Good luck!
    
## Don't forget, perseverance is really important when it doesn't work, but never hesitate to ask for a hint!!!
